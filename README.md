**Welcome to the FloorBot Commander CLI!**

**Compilation**\
The provided CLI.exe was compiled and built using Windows 10, so if your OS matches that, then it may be sufficient to run that.

Otherwise, **the main file to run is CLI.cpp, which was developed and compiled using msys64 g++** located here:
https://www.msys2.org/

If you're using VSCode, the provided .vscode settings.json and tasks.json file should be configured to automatically compile the active window (this should be CLI.cpp), if your g++.exe is located at the following default path:
"C:/msys64/ucrt64/bin/g++.exe"


**GitHub Repo**\
All code is remotely stored in a public GitHub repository, which can be cloned in the event anything goes wrong:

**Thank you testing the CLI out, we hope it works well!**
